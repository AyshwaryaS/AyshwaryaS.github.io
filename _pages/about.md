I am a Computational Biologist at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org) working in the labs of [Anna Greka](http://grekalab.bwh.harvard.edu/anna-greka/) and [Aviv Regev](https://www.broadinstitute.org/regev-lab). My research focus is single-cell biology, primarily approaches for understanding human health and disease leveraging single-cell transcriptomics. I am involved in the [Human Cell Atlas's](https://www.humancellatlas.org) efforts on kidney. 

I am interested in the design, development, and applications of computational data analyses
methods for the understanding of human health and disease, its prevention and treatment. I completed my PhD at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) under the supervision of [Russell Schwartz](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~russells/). My dissertation focused on developing computational methods for resolving heterogeneity in high-throughput data from tumors, detecting progression markers, and using these markers for phylogenetic inference. My postdoctoral training was completed at the [Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Healthâ€™s](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu) [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/), with [Curtis Huttenhower](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu) and [Rafael Irizarry](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/rafael-irizarry/), where I developed probabilistic models of transcriptional activity states from bulk transcriptome sequencing data and approaches for analysis of metagenomic data.
